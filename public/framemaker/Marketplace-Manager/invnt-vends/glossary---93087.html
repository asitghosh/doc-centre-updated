 You can allow or forbid product upgrades and downgrades globally on your marketplace. Check or clear pertinent Subscription Update Options checkboxes in the Contracts area at <span class="EH-EmphasisHeavy">

 Billing Settings | <span class="EH-EmphasisHeavy">

When your marketplace forbids product upgrades and downgrades, there is no reason for vendors to set edition rank values. In this case, consistency suggests that you should disable edition ranking.</p>
