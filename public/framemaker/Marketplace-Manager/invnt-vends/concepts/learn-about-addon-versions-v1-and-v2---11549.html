<p class="B1-Body1">
<a name="pgfId-2212444"></a>Most addon references in this chapter include a notation of either <span class="EH-EmphasisHeavy">
v1</span>
 or <span class="EH-EmphasisHeavy">
v2</span>. Such notations indicate whether information applies to our first implementation of addons or our second. Some marketplaces support v1 exclusively. On other marketplaces, the two implementations coexist for now. We intend that v2 should replace v1 on all marketplaces in 2017.</p>

<a name="pgfId-2212943"></a>In <span class="EH-EmphasisHeavy">
v1</span>
, each addon is a supplemental service or capacity that can be applied to one product exclusively. </li>
<ul>
<li class="Bu2-Bullet2">
<a name="pgfId-2216818"></a>The product and each of its configured v1 addons share their vendor in common. </li>
<li class="Bu2-Bullet2">
<a name="pgfId-2216843"></a>No one can buy a v1 addon who has not already completed the purchase flow for the associated product. </li>
<li class="Bu2-Bullet2">
<a name="pgfId-2216860"></a>A product and its v1 addon orders are separate, as are their billing. </li>
<li class="Bu2-Bullet2">
<a name="pgfId-2216877"></a>Although a vendor can export a product’s settings from one marketplace for import — as XML — into another, v1 addons are not portable between products or between marketplaces. </li>
<li class="Bu2-Bullet2">
<a name="pgfId-2216894"></a>v1 addons cannot be discounted. </li>
<li class="Bu2-Bullet2">
<a name="pgfId-2216911"></a>The MyApps page does not show any tile for a v1 addon. </li>
<li class="Bu2-Bullet2">
<a name="pgfId-2216928"></a>Any vendor can create and sell v1 addons for its own products by default.</li>
</ul>
<li class="Bu1N-Bullet1-w-Next">
<a name="pgfId-2213323"></a>In <span class="EH-EmphasisHeavy">
v2</span>
, an addon is a product in its own right, albeit one with only one configured edition, which serves no useful purpose until it is associated with at least one of the products it can supplement. </li>
<ul>
<li class="Bu2-Bullet2">
<a name="pgfId-2217134"></a>Where vendors in v1 configured an addon’s essential traits while configuring the paired product’s own traits, v2 supports a standalone workflow for addon configuration, with both its own service type and a dedicated product dashboard in Developer Center. </li>
<li class="Bu2-Bullet2">
<a name="pgfId-2217158"></a>A product and its v2 addon are ordered separately but share one invoice per billing cycle. </li>
<li class="Bu2-Bullet2">
<a name="pgfId-2217171"></a>Vendors can export a v2 addon’s settings from one marketplace for import — as XML — into another. </li>
<li class="Bu2-Bullet2">
<a name="pgfId-2217195"></a>v2 addons can be discounted. </li>
<li class="Bu2-Bullet2">
<a name="pgfId-2217208"></a>The MyApps page shows a dedicated tile for each v2 addon that a user is assigned to use.</li>

 Vendors on your marketplace cannot create or sell v2 addons until AppDirect enables v2 at your request.</p>
