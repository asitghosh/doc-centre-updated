 TIP: </span>
 We developed this material for use by someone with the <span class="EI-EmphasisItalic">
channel administrator</span>
 user role. When you lack this role assignment, at least some described features are not available to you. To learn which user roles you have on a marketplace instance, go to <span class="LT-LinkText">
https://{host}/profile</span>
 and read through the User Information area on the Profile tab. (Note, however, that you see this information about your personal account at <span class="LT-LinkText">
/profile</span>
 only when you are a <span class="EI-EmphasisItalic">
company administrator</span>. Registered users who lack the <span class="EI-EmphasisItalic">
company administrator</span>
 role cannot see their role assignments at <span class="LT-LinkText">
/profile</span>.) Then, to learn which features pertain to your assigned roles, see <a href="/fm/21102" class="XRef">User role basics</a>.</p>
