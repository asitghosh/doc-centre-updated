<a name="pgfId-1684015"></a>The <span class="EI-EmphasisItalic">
reseller</span>
 user role is now assignable to the company’s associated users. And, the subset of them who actually receive this role assignment can see and use Reseller Center — on a marketplace that is configured to show Reseller Center — in addition to seeing and using ordinary consumer features. You can edit the company’s access types later, as needed.</p>
<p class="SB-StepBody">
<a name="pgfId-1684016"></a><span class="EH-EmphasisHeavy">
Do not check any checkboxes in the User Access area.</span>
 Lacking any specialist user role assignments, the company’s first user is simply a <span class="EI-EmphasisItalic">
company administrator</span>. However, you can add other role assignments to his or her account later, as needed, including the <span class="EI-EmphasisItalic">
reseller</span>
 role.</p>

 NOTE: </span>
 The company’s first associated user might be wholly new to your marketplace instance, or might already be registered with an association to some other company than this one. In the former case, a brand-new user account is prepared, which its invitee must still <a href="/fm/65465" class="XRef">activation</a>. In the latter case, the registered user receives an <a href="/fm/57693" class="XRef"><span class="EH-EmphasisHeavy">
association</span></a> request in email and, upon accepting it, becomes associated with both companies instead of merely one. <span class="EH-EmphasisHeavy">
There is no limit to how many company associations can be tied to a user account that they all share in common.<br>
</span>
<br>
Because product assignments occur within the context of a company association, the registered user who has multiple company associations must context-switch between them — from a special menu that is visible to such users exclusively — to use his or her assigned products or access any files that are bound to a product seat assignment.<br>
<br>
Similarly, <a href="/fm/42949" class="XRef"><span class="EH-EmphasisHeavy">
user role</span></a> assignments are also bound separately to each of a registered user’s company associations. The user who context-switches between associated companies could observe that his or her levels of access vary in each company context, and that the set of exposed UI elements also changes.</p>
