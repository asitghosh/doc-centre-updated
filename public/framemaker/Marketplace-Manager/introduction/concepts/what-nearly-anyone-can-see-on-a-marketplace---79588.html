 Some providers configure their marketplaces to hide content from unregistered users. When your preferred marketplace is one of these, you must register a user account, activate your new account, and then log in to it before you can see most of the features that topics in this guide describe.</p>

<a name="pgfId-1207332"></a>Every AppDirect-powered marketplace has a page that loads first, by default, even for unregistered visitors. This is the landing page. It might function like a welcome screen (with a video tutorial, for example), link extensively to marketing material and white papers, or be a listing page that drops you directly into a shopping experience. </p></div>

<p class="B1-Body1">
<a name="pgfId-1207316"></a>A clickable product list helps you to browse, find, and compare the products that matter most to you. Alternatively, you can render the product list as a paginated, multi-dimensional grid.</p>
<p class="B1-Body1">
<a name="pgfId-1337998"></a>Listing pages support browsing the product catalog on a given marketplace. They expose the defined product categories and emphasize specific products that meet certain criteria.</p>

<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p class="CB-CellBody">
<a name="pgfId-1300504"></a>Within the product catalog on a given marketplace, a provider can organize products together that serve a job function or business goal in common. For example, products within a “collaboration” category would often — but not inevitably — differ from products within a “marketing” category. However, a product that supports more than one of the purposes or goals that underlie a provider’s defined categories can easily belong to more than one category at a time. Categories help consumers to browse and find products quickly that are the most appropriate and useful to them.</p>
