<a name="pgfId-1948979"></a>An AppDirect-powered <a href="/fm/53566" class="XRef"><span class="EH-EmphasisHeavy">
marketplace</span></a> serves the overlapping needs of its diverse population of <a href="/fm/90449" class="XRef"><span class="EH-EmphasisHeavy">
consumer</span></a>s, <a href="/fm/76859" class="XRef"><span class="EH-EmphasisHeavy">
developer</span></a>s, <a href="/fm/96562" class="XRef"><span class="EH-EmphasisHeavy">
reseller</span></a>s, <a href="/fm/50589" class="XRef"><span class="EH-EmphasisHeavy">
provider</span></a>s, and others. We subdivide these broad user categories — which also designate the various <a href="/fm/39519" class="XRef"><span class="EH-EmphasisHeavy">
company</span></a> types — into multiple, discrete user roles, <span class="EH-EmphasisHeavy">
which are assignable to registered users exclusively</span>. Users who all share a given role assignment in common also share certain expectations, needs, and goals in common. AppDirect supports a range of user roles for a range of purposes. </p>

 TIP: </span>
 This guide consists of related books that focus on the goals and authority of one user role apiece. <span class="EI-EmphasisItalic">
Channel administrators</span>
 can learn about company and user account management in the Marketplace Manager book chapter called <span class="EH-EmphasisHeavy">
Customers</span>. </p>

<a name="pgfId-1947490"></a>What is a visitor?</p>
<p class="B1-Body1">
<a name="pgfId-1950379"></a>When this guide touches upon the superficial access that some marketplaces allow to unauthenticated users — including those who are unauthenticated precisely because they have not registered any user account — it calls these people “visitors.” This pseudo-role is implicit and conditional. It exists on some marketplaces but not others and is never explicitly assigned. </p>
<p class="B1-Body1">
<a name="pgfId-1949338"></a>All other user roles assignments are explicit and active, meaning that registered users receive them through an administrator’s deliberate intervention.</p>
<p class="BL-BlockLabel">
<a name="pgfId-1947218"></a>User role variations</p>
<p class="B1-Body1">
<a name="pgfId-1950415"></a>User roles and their names are somewhat variable from one marketplace to another, because some roles are not relevant to some business plans and preferred terminology can differ regionally or by industry. Furthermore, some roles must be enabled per marketplace before they are assignable to any user, or must be enabled per company before they are assignable to a given company's associated users.</p>
<p class="B1-Body1">
<a name="pgfId-1947124"></a><span class="EH-EmphasisHeavy">
User role names and descriptions in this guide are generic and might differ from user roles as your marketplace implements them.</span>
</p>
<p class="B1-Body1">
<a name="pgfId-1208537"></a>Certain potentially available user roles on a given marketplace:</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li class="Bu1-Bullet1">
<a name="pgfId-1288853"></a>Might be restricted to some <a href="/fm/92725" class="XRef"><span class="EH-EmphasisHeavy">
plan</span></a>s in particular.</li>
<li class="Bu1-Bullet1">
<a name="pgfId-1367624"></a>Might be disabled at the provider’s request and unavailable for <a href="/fm/28519" class="XRef"><span class="EH-EmphasisHeavy">

<li class="Bu1-Bullet1">
<a name="pgfId-1367489"></a>Are only ever enabled upon the provider’s request to AppDirect.</li>
<li class="Bu1-Bullet1">
<a name="pgfId-1288925"></a>Are available for assignment only under narrow conditions.</li>
<li class="Bu1-Bullet1">

<p class="B1-Body1">
<a name="pgfId-1289087"></a>Additional limitations may also apply, as follows.</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li class="Bu1-Bullet1">
<a name="pgfId-1288927"></a>The UI labels that specify user role names can be changed per marketplace, upon the provider’s request to AppDirect.</li>
<li class="Bu1-Bullet1">
<a name="pgfId-1288928"></a>Some marketplaces implement additional, nonstandard user roles.</li>
<li class="Bu1-Bullet1">
<a name="pgfId-1288929"></a>The user roles that are assigned to you constrain which other user roles you can see, assign, and manage, if any.</li>
