 button on a product profile, you enter a linear sequence of UI pages that we call the <span class="EI-EmphasisItalic">
purchase flow</span>
 for that described product. A purchase flow guides you sequentially through the end-to-end process to buy or try the described product. A typical purchase flow includes four pages. However, some products carry additional prerequisites, which inject a supplemental form that the buyer must also complete when prompted.  </p>
