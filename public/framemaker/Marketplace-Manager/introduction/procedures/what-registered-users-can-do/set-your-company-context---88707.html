<p class="B1-Body1">
<a name="pgfId-1216716"></a>Is your registered user account on a given marketplace instance associated with more than one company? For example, you might work part-time at each of two different companies that both obtain their SaaS products through the same marketplace. Or, you might work for one company that uses a marketplace, while you also lend technical support to the employees of some other company. </p>
<p class="B1-Body1">
<a name="pgfId-1217961"></a>If so, you can switch your marketplace context from any one of your associated companies to any other (and back again) at your discretion. Each context has its own settings and options for your account, depending on which user role assignments their respective company administrators have granted you. In addition, you could have access to an entirely different set of products, depending on which company context you use.</p>

 NOTE: </span>
 Company context-switching UI elements are present only when your account on a given marketplace is associated with multiple companies. Otherwise, when your account is associated with only one company, we hide such elements from you because they are not relevant to you.</p>

<span class="step-label">Step 1.</span><span class="step-text">
<a name="pgfId-1217026"></a>	Choose an option from the <code class="S-Sample">
{Your Company Name}</code>
 hybrid button (where <code class="S-Sample">
{Your Company Name}</code>
 is literally the name of your now-active company association), which — when it appears at all — appears to the right of the Manage hybrid button.</span>

 TIP: </span>
 The <code class="S-Sample">
{Your Company Name}</code>
 hybrid button is visible to you only while you maintain simultaneous associations with multiple companies. If you do not see an option like this one when you look at your marketplace, it means that you have only one company association right now and, for the time being, this procedure does not apply to you.</p>
<p class="SB-StepBody">
<a name="pgfId-1385318"></a>When you switch from one of your company contexts to another, the hybrid button label also changes. It always cites whichever of your contexts is in effect right now.</p>
<p class="SB-StepBody">
<a name="pgfId-1385739"></a>Other user interface elements might appear or disappear each time that you switch your context, according to your user role assignments, your assigned products, and whichever company class (consumer, vendor, reseller, or provider) now shapes your authority.</p>
