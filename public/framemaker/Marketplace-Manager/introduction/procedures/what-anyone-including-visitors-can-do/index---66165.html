 NOTE: </span>
 Some marketplaces use stealth mode, hiding their every detail behind a sitewide username and password, which all of their sufficiently authorized users share in common. When a marketplace is obscured in this way, your login at that high level only compels the site to start sending data to your browser for rendering. Such data could include the individualized login form, through which you can then access your personal settings and products. However, most marketplaces that implement sitewide obscurity expose the high-level login credentials to a small number of trusted staff and other, well-trusted insiders while their marketplace undergoes internal acceptance testing. </p>

 Some marketplaces reserve even their most basic features to registered users exclusively. When your browser loads a marketplace of this kind and you are not logged in to your individual account, you see two options at most: You can either register a new account or log in to your personal account. </p>
