In aggregate, the products that are joined together in a bundle serve at least one high-level goal of their target consumer. For example, the constituent products in a bundle could all support certain duties that are common among personnel managers at companies with fewer than 100 employees. Or, a bundle might include separate applications that respectively support the accounting, procurement, HR, and marketing goals of a small enterprise.

<p class="GD-GlossaryDefinition">
<a name="pgfId-1260778"></a>For simplicity’s sake, we use the word “company” to identify any organization that sponsors registered users on an AppDirect-powered marketplace. Organizational sponsorship lends legitimacy and accountability to each registered user account. In fact, no user account can exist or persist on the AppDirect platform without maintaining at least one “company” association at all times. </p>

<li class="Bu1-Bullet1">
<a name="pgfId-1366836"></a>The four company classes are channel, vendor, reseller, and consumer. In a typical implementation, only one company per marketplace instance has the channel class — because this class is reserved to the marketplace provider, exclusively. Nonetheless, the other three class types can easily apply to dozens or hundreds of registered companies apiece. </li>
<li class="Bu1-Bullet1">
<a name="pgfId-1366939"></a>A given company’s broad classification is one of the factors that constrains which user roles are even theoretically available for assignment to its associated users. For example, the <span class="EI-EmphasisItalic">
developer</span>
 user role is assignable only to registered users whose associated company has the vendor classification. Nonetheless, a given user might maintain multiple company associations at the same time and, through context-switching, explore differing scopes of authority in each of his or her company contexts.</li>
<li class="Bu1-Bullet1">
<a name="pgfId-1366839"></a>A given company might not even be a company at all, as such, in the real world. It could be a governmental agency, an educational institution, a charitable organization, a self-employed person, or nearly anything else. Any organization can be a “company,” including a larger organization’s constituent divisions, departments, or satellite offices.</li>
<li class="Bu1-Bullet1">
<a name="pgfId-1366826"></a>A registered user might be associated with more than one registered company at the same time. In this case, the user can switch easily between his or her associated companies, which naturally — because each user role assignment exists in the context of one company association — affects which of his or her user role assignments are currently in effect.</li>
