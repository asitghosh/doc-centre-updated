<p class="B1-Body1">
<a name="pgfId-1737511"></a>Most of the notification templates that you see listed on the Customer Emails page are built-in to the AppDirect platform and are designed to satisfy the business cases of as many partners as possible. However, you might see other templates there as well, if your employer — the marketplace provider — requested that we implement custom templates for your exclusive use. </p>

 NOTE: </span>
 Even though our built-in templates are event-driven, many custom templates are not. Instead, you address them individually, and then send them manually to their recipients. This topic describes only our standard, built-in templates, which are the vast majority.</p>
<p class="B1-Body1">
<a name="pgfId-1810905"></a>Each generated notification message is triggered when an event has happened or is about to happen, and targets a registered user whose relationship with the triggering event meets predefined criteria. For example, the trigger might be creation of a new order or expiration of the payment method for an active order. Meanwhile, the intended recipient might be the product’s developer, a registered user who is assigned to one of the seats that the active order allocated, or whomever has authority to pay for the order.</p>
<p class="B1-Body1">
<a name="pgfId-1768765"></a>Essentially, any marketplace-related event that might matter to a given user probably has an associated template. Broadly, these are the events that create or change our records for such database entities as a user, a company, a product, a product edition, an order, a payment, a payment method, a contract, or the relationship between two entities.</p>
