<a name="pgfId-1887593"></a>When you contracted with a financial services firm to authorize and process all incoming payments for your marketplace, that firm issued text strings to you, which your marketplace must return exactly to the firm’s payment gateway during each transaction. </p>
<p class="B1N-Body1-with-Next">
<a name="pgfId-1913871"></a>AppDirect has already configured your marketplace to return these mandatory values correctly. However, you can edit them if they change for any reason.</p>

 CAUTION: </span>
 Do not change payment gateway entries frivolously. Doing so can cause billing operations to fail. This, in turn, can lead vendors to suspend user access to their products. Such disruptions can jeopardize your organization’s reputation, partnerships, and revenue.</p>

Password Policy</span>
</p>
<p class="B1N-Body1-with-Next">
<a name="pgfId-1818943"></a>User account passwords help to protect your customers against data theft, social engineering, and financial fraud, while also helping to preserve your own organization’s reputation as a provider of trustworthy services.</p>
<p class="B1N-Body1-with-Next">
<a name="pgfId-1915502"></a>You must choose and apply a password security policy from among three predefined options. These alternatives differ in their rules for password length and complexity.</p>
<p class="Sp-SignpostParagraph

<a name="pgfId-1915729"></a><span class="SpF-SignpostFlag">
 TIP: </span>
 We recommend that you always choose and apply the most secure policy. We recommend this because strong passwords are objectively better than weak ones at doing what a password is meant to do. Strong passwords are more effective than weak ones at preventing fraud and theft. Strong passwords are more effective than weak ones at protecting intangible assets, including your organization’s reputation and brand equity. Also, strong passwords are less vulnerable than weak ones to social engineering, dictionary attacks, and brute force attacks. </p>
