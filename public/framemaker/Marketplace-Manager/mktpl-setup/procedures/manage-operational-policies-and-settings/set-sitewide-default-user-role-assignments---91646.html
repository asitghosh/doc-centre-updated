Set the default role for all new users to be a </span>

developer</span>
 — A <span class="EI-EmphasisItalic">
developer</span>
 builds software products, owns the associated copyrights, patents, and trademarks (or works for a vendor that owns these things), and sells access to them through one or more marketplaces. Every <span class="EI-EmphasisItalic">
developer</span>
 is associated with a company in the <span class="EI-EmphasisItalic">
vendor</span>
 class, so this user role should not be assigned to all users by default unless your company (the provider of your marketplace) sells PaaS and/or IaaS services to a large community of developers. Registered <span class="EI-EmphasisItalic">
developers</span>
 can build and edit products, request to integrate these products into your marketplace, and accept or decline requests from the providers of other marketplaces on your same deployment instance to offer for sale the products that he or she has integrated natively to your marketplace. A user with this role has authenticated access to his or her company's own products and API integration events. <span class="EI-EmphasisItalic">
Developers</span>
 populate their own product profiles, subject to your oversight. In some cases, a <span class="EI-EmphasisItalic">
developer</span>
 can also see and work with information about his or her own bills, customers, and payouts.</span></li>

Company administrators</span>
 can access and change all of their company's data. They also have limited authority to manage user permissions.</span></li>
